The program gives an out as:
{ firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Smith' }

The function receives 2 variables exports=null and module={exports{}}.
Then module.exports is assigned to the exports.
Then a property firstName is assigned to exports which is also updating module.exports.
Then another property lastname is also added to module.exports directly.
At another step exports is now being reassigned a new object with a function variable getFullName.
This has no impact on module.exports though.
And then in the end, module.exports is being returned from the function which as we know have the
attributes  firstname and lastname hence giving an output as such.
